# JS-Typing Speed Checker ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰

## About the Project
This project is a typing speed checker that is built using vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to test and improve their typing skills by measuring their speed and accuracy. It features currently include a timer and a wrong word detector. The timer tracks the amount of time it takes the user to type a passage of text, and the wrong word detection feature keeps track of the number of words that the user types incorrectly.

It was a fun transition from using typing speed checkers to building one from scratch. It helped me effectively apply all of my JavaScript knowledge that I have gained up until now.

## Ideas for Future Updates
The project is still under development, and there are a number of features that I would like to add in the future. These features include:

- ```Randomized Sentences``` : Instead of using the same known sentences every time, fetch random sentences from an API. This will add variety and replayability to the game.
- ```Different difficulty levels``` : Create different difficulty levels by changing the length of the quotes, the speed at which they are displayed, and the number of errors allowed.
- ```Leaderboards``` : Create a leaderboard to track the scores of players over time. This can help players to compete with each other and improve their typing speed.
- ```Progress tracking``` : track the progress of players over time by showing them their average typing speed and accuracy. This can help players to see how they are improving and motivate them to keep practicing. Additionally can also add functinality to allow players to earn points as they progress in the game.
- ```Add Customization``` : allow players to customize and choose the background color, the font size and the genre of quotes based on their mood. This can make the game more fun and engaging for different players.
- ```Sound effect``` : Sound effects can provide audio feedback and enhance the overall experience of the game. Some sound effects which can be considered: Level completion sound, Typing sound, Correct and incorrect feedback etc.
- ```Animations``` :  Animations can add visual interest and interactivity to your game. Some ideas for incorporating animations include: Typing animations, Victory animations, Transition animations etc.
- ```Deployment``` :  Deploying the game online would allow multiple players to compete against each other in real-time, making the game more interesting.

I'm always looking for ways to improve the game, so if you have any suggestions for new features, please feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/vishalsingh2972/JS-TypingSpeedChecker/pulls) for review. I'd love to hear your ideas!
